Compile and Run Instructions for showing basic connectivity

ssh to vm.  
cd /home/jtvaught/projectfiles   (I have set this to rwx globally recursively so you can all get in here)
javac ServerCommsDeprecated
java ServerCommsDeprecated  (alternativelyto run in background java ServerComms &)

from another machine 

javac ServCommTestBench
java ServCommTestBench


Watch echos.


While ServerCommsDeprecated is still running on the VM
Launch Mobile App Sim, show message received by server (recommended not running servcommsdep in background)
Show message received back by mobile app in console of sim tools


To show that the DB is running and table is built

in VM

mysql -h localhost -u handler -p
<enter handler as password when requested>
show databases;
use squaddb;
show tables;
describe users;
select * from users;
